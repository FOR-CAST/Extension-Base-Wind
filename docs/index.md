# What is the Base Fire Extension?

Base Fire generates wildfires that are dependent upon fire region (or 'landtype') specific inputs. Base Fire follows the principles of older LANDIS versions (v3.6 and earlier) whereby fire patches are put on the landscape following a log-normal size distribution and fire severity is a function of time-since-last-fire.
