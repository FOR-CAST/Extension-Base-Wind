# What is the Original Wind Extension?

Original Wind generates circular, elliptical, or linear wind events, dependent upon wind speed. Wind events are not sensitive to landscape continuity. Inputs are dependent upon ecoregion specific inputs. Original Wind follows the principles of older LANDIS versions (v3.6 and earlier).
